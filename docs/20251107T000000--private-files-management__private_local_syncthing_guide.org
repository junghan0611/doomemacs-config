* Overview

This document describes the private local files used in this Doom Emacs configuration that are NOT committed to Git but ARE synchronized via Syncthing (or similar tools).

This approach allows:
- Public sharing of general configuration via Git
- Private management of personal data and machine-specific settings
- Seamless synchronization across devices without exposing sensitive information

* Private Files List

** Personal Configuration Files

*** =custom.el=
- *Purpose*: Emacs custom-set-variables and custom-set-faces
- *Content*: Machine-generated customizations from Emacs customize interface
- *Why Private*: May contain personal preferences and file paths

*** =per-machine.el=
- *Purpose*: Machine-specific configuration overrides
- *Content*: Settings that differ per device (paths, performance tuning, etc.)
- *Why Private*: Contains local system paths and device-specific settings

*** =user-keys.el=
- *Purpose*: Personal API keys and authentication tokens
- *Content*: Keys for services (OpenAI, GitHub, etc.)
- *Why Private*: Contains sensitive credentials

*** =+office.el=
- *Purpose*: Office/work-related configuration
- *Content*: Work-specific settings and integrations
- *Why Private*: May contain work-related information

** Content and Templates

*** =inbox__human.org=
- *Purpose*: Personal inbox for quick capture and notes
- *Content*: Daily thoughts, tasks, and temporary notes
- *Why Private*: Contains personal information and work-in-progress content

*** =templates/=
- *Purpose*: Personal document templates
- *Content*: Org-mode templates, snippets, boilerplate text
- *Why Private*: Contains personal writing patterns and custom templates

*** =fortune/=
- *Purpose*: Fortune cookie database
- *Content*: Custom fortune messages and quotes
- *Why Private*: Personal collection of quotes and messages

*** =CLAUDE.md=
- *Purpose*: Claude AI interaction notes
- *Content*: Context and instructions for Claude Code sessions
- *Why Private*: Contains personal project notes and AI interaction history

** Development and Cache Files

*** =.claude/=
- *Purpose*: Claude Code CLI configuration
- *Content*: Claude Code settings, history, and cached data
- *Why Private*: Contains local tool state and personal usage patterns

*** =tempel-templates.eld= / =var/tempel-templates.eld=
- *Purpose*: Compiled Tempel template cache
- *Content*: Binary/serialized template data
- *Why Private*: Auto-generated cache file, can be rebuilt

*** =ccmenu=
- *Purpose*: Command center menu cache
- *Content*: Cached menu data
- *Why Private*: Auto-generated cache file

** Security Files

*** =var/sensitive-strings.txt=
- *Purpose*: Sensitive strings for redaction/filtering
- *Content*: Passwords, tokens, or other secrets to protect
- *Why Private*: *CRITICAL* - Contains actual secrets, must NEVER be committed

* Synchronization Strategy

** Git Repository (Public)
- Core configuration files (=config.el=, =init.el=, =packages.el=)
- Module configurations (=modules/=)
- Scripts and utilities (=bin/=)
- Documentation (=docs/=)
- README and guides

** Syncthing (Private)
- All files listed above in this document
- Synchronized across personal devices
- Not exposed in public repository
- Allows local-only content to stay in sync

** Workflow
1. Public configuration changes → commit to Git
2. Private files changes → auto-sync via Syncthing
3. New machine setup:
   - Clone Git repository
   - Install Syncthing and connect to sync folder
   - Private files automatically appear

* Setup Instructions

** For New Users (Creating Your Own Private Files)

1. Start with the public configuration:
   #+begin_src bash
   git clone <your-fork-url> ~/.config/doom
   #+end_src

2. Create your private files as needed:
   - =custom.el= - Will be created by Emacs automatically
   - =per-machine.el= - Create if you need machine-specific settings
   - =user-keys.el= - Create for API keys
   - =inbox__human.org= - Create for personal notes
   - =templates/= - Create for custom templates

3. (Optional) Set up Syncthing:
   - Install Syncthing on all your devices
   - Share the Doom config directory
   - Private files sync automatically

4. All these files are already in =.gitignore=, so they won't be committed

** For This Configuration Owner (Restoration)

If you accidentally delete private files (e.g., via =git clean -xfd=):

1. Wait for Syncthing to restore from other devices
2. Or manually copy from backup
3. Or restore from Syncthing versioning if enabled

* Best Practices

1. *Never commit sensitive files* - Always verify =.gitignore= is correct
2. *Use separate files for secrets* - Don't mix public and private config
3. *Test on clean checkout* - Ensure public config works standalone
4. *Document dependencies* - Make it clear when features need private files
5. *Encrypt sensitive data* - Consider encrypting =var/sensitive-strings.txt=
6. *Regular backups* - Don't rely solely on Syncthing for critical data

* File Organization Philosophy

This configuration follows a clear separation:
- *Public* = Useful to others, no personal data
- *Private* = Personal data, credentials, or work-in-progress
- *Generated* = Can be rebuilt, doesn't need git tracking

This makes it easy to:
- Share configuration publicly
- Keep personal data private
- Maintain consistency across devices
- Onboard new machines quickly

Anyone can adopt this pattern for their own configuration!
